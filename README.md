## RAIN App
#### A place to record your thoughts for further examining

Have you ever wanted to express something that might be better kept off Twitter?

RAIN App is a modeled after Tara Brach's [RAIN](https://www.tarabrach.com/articles-interviews/rain-workingwithdifficulties/)
as a way to process our emotions mixed with [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034)'s
tendency to ponder what unmet need exists associated with these emotions in an
attempt to identify the pain-body and seperate from the ego as discussed in
[New Earth](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=new+earth).

R- recognize

A- Allow to just be

I- Investigate inner experience with kindness

N- Non-Identification

You can record your thoughts somewhere for yourself.  Come back at a later time
after you have sit with it for a bit in order to examine it further.  You can
identify if it still resonantes with you or not.

We all want to feel "heard".  This is a tool for you to have that start with
yourself.
